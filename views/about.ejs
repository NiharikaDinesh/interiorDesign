          <p>It all started as a passionate dream! A dream of creating welcoming places and wonderful
              experiences, a
              dream of touching human minds, a dream of connecting with various people and being a part of
              their
              story! The idea was to create a wonderful home experience that tells the story of the
              homeowner.<br><br>

              Every space has its own purpose. Our task is to understand, see and implement it. We are an
              architectural
              bureau that reveals new facets of the minimalism philosophy to the world.We deliver inspired

              that
              is why
              our clients keep coming back – project after project and year after year. <br><br>The Design Group
              combines
              extraordinary talent and global experiences to create spaces, nationally and worldwide, that

          <p>Whether its honesty and sincerity or diligence and persistence, our talented team of
              interior
              decorators, architects and interior designers share organizational values and
              principles, along
              with a common vision. As a company, our skilled team is our biggest asset and we believe
              in
              investing in all members of our team, to help them achieve their maximum
              potential.<br><br>

              Our premium interior design services are backed by over a decade of industry experience
              and the
              unique expertise of our staff. In our pursuit of excellence, we push the boundaries of
              interior
              design each and every day.<br><br>

              In the case of residential interior design, we focus on luxury, comfort and
              practicality, while
              keeping in mind the clients’ requirements and the latest international trends. Our aim
              is to
              create visually stunning spaces, which not only fulfil our clients’ requirements but
              also exceed
              their expectations.<br><br>

              When dealing with commercial interior design, our clients’ budgets and timelines are
              given
              utmost importance. Our endeavor is to present the brand image to clients and staff in a
              positive
              way, and to create a healthy, functional and comfortable working atmosphere that is
              bright and
              user friendly.<br><br>

              What some interior designing firms tend to forget is that their clients’ requirements
              need to be
              at the centre of every design; something we keep in mind. At every stage, due
              consideration is
              given to our clients’ requirements, their unique taste, their budget and most
              importantly, their
              timelines.</p>
